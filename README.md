# flask-doctor-app
This is a simple web application built using Flask. It allows patients to book appointments with doctors, and doctors can confirm or cancel appointments. The app also includes user authentication and a basic dashboard for both patients and doctors.

Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in. There are two types of users: patient and doctor.
Appointment Booking: Patients can book appointments with doctors, and the status of the appointments can be confirmed or canceled by the doctors.
Doctor Dashboard: Doctors can view their appointments, confirm or cancel them, and update their details.
Patient Dashboard: Patients can view available doctors and their confirmed appointments.
AI-Powered Image Analysis: Doctors can upload medical images (e.g., X-rays, scans) for AI analysis. The system predicts the likelihood of certain conditions (e.g., cancer) and displays the result with a confidence score.
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Database: MySQL
Password Hashing: Flask-Bcrypt
User Authentication: Flask-Login
Image Upload and Prediction: Flask file upload functionality with integration to a trained AI model (using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or a custom model) to analyze uploaded medical images for diagnostic purposes.
AI Image Analysis
The application integrates with a machine learning model that can analyze medical images. Here's how it works:

Upload Image: Doctors can upload images (e.g., X-rays or MRI scans) through the doctor dashboard.
Prediction: The AI model processes the image and predicts whether a condition (like cancer) is present. The model provides a predicted class (e.g., "absence of cancer") and a confidence score.
Result Display: The result, including the predicted class and confidence score, is displayed to the doctor for further review.
Setup
Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/appointment-booking-app.git
cd appointment-booking-app
Install the required dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the MySQL database. Make sure to create the necessary tables for user authentication, appointments, and image data.

Configure the AI model:

If using a pre-trained model (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), ensure the model file (e.g., model.pt for PyTorch) is placed in the correct directory.
Update the Flask route responsible for image upload and prediction to use the model for processing the image.
Start the Flask server:

flask run
Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
